The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven.[8] The word Internet was used in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.[9] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[10]

When it came into common use, most publications treated the word Internet as a capitalized proper noun; this has become less common.[10] This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar.[10][11] The word is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook since 2016, recommend the lowercase form in every case.[10][11] In 2016, the Oxford English Dictionary found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, "Internet" was capitalized in 54% of cases.[12]

The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably; it is common to speak of "going on the Internet" when using a web browser to view web pages. However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of Internet services,[13] a collection of documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.[14]
